Hi Jan,

Following on from the initial commands provided earlier, I wanted to send an
early set of patches for review, feedback and iteration.

There is an /proc/interrupts command on the way too but that will be later,
and I wanted to get these started.

Particular commentry is either in the comments area of the patch, or in the
code itself.

A particular coding-style question is on the docstrings. Most of the existing
commands do not indent their multiline docstrings. Is this preferred?

And also, what is your take on line-length.
Should it be hard and fast always < 79, or OK > if it keeps things readable?:

pep8 proc.py
proc.py:321:80: E501 line too long (80 > 79 characters)
proc.py:363:80: E501 line too long (80 > 79 characters)
proc.py:365:80: E501 line too long (82 > 79 characters)
proc.py:378:80: E501 line too long (80 > 79 characters)

These 4 lines come from [PATCH 5/5] scripts/gdb: Add meminfo command
If I move the helper class functions out to file scope, that could trim
the 'self.' keyword, and make the lines a little shorter ...

Anyway, I look forward to hearing your comments, and any input from any other
interested parties too!

If anyone has any ideas for commands that they would like to see available,
or useful kernel parsers, now is a great time to get involved!


Regards
