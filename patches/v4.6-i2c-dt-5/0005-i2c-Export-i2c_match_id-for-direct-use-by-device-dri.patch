Subject: [PATCHv5 5/8] i2c: Export i2c_match_id() for direct use by device
 drivers

When there was no other way to match a I2C device to driver i2c_match_id()
was exclusively used.  However, now there are other types of tables which
are commonly supplied, matching on an i2c_device_id table is used less
frequently.  Instead of _always_ calling i2c_match_id() from within the
framework, we only need to do so from drivers which have no other way of
matching.  This patch makes i2c_match_id() available to the aforementioned
device drivers.
