Renesas R-Car Fine Display Processor (FDP1)
-----------------------------------------------

The FDP1 is a de-interlacing module which converts interlaced video to
progressive video. It is capable of performing pixel format conversion between
YCbCr/YUV formats and RGB formats. Only YCbCr/YUV formats are supported as
an input to the module.

 - compatible: Must be one or more of the following

   - "renesas,r8a7795-fdp1" for R8A7795 (R-Car H3)
   - "renesas,r8a7796-fdp1" for R8A7796 (R-Car M3-W)
   - "renesas,fdp1" for generic compatible

   When compatible with the generic version, nodes must list the
   SoC-specific version corresponding to the platform first, followed by the
   family-specific and/or generic versions.

 - reg: the register base and size for the device registers
 - clocks: Reference to the functional clock
 - renesas,fcp: Reference to the FCPF connected to the FDP1
